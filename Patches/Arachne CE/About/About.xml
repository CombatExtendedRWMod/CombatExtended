	<description>A compatibility patch for Arachne race and Combat Extended 1.6.
	
	The Arachne Bullets have been removed because having special ammo for a single gun didn't make much sense.
	The fact that I didn't manage to successfully patch in custom ammo yet is clearly unrelated........
	The Arachne P90 now uses the same caliber as in the real world.
