This is not what I signed up for!
I should have stayed home!
A little more lead and I'll turn into a statue!
I'm cool! Don't hit me!
I need a change of underwear!
One, two, three...am I still alive? Four, five
I hope that's not my spleen there on the floor
This is messed up!
Dammit!
It's time to study the enemy from afar!
Its easier to be brave from a distance!
Do you even know who I am?!
Don't hit me, I'm a certified idiot!
People aren't afraid of dying but of loosing their life!
Better to get a bit wet than get a lot dead.
This ain't at all like taking candy from a baby!
Aaaahhhhhh-aaaaaaaahhhh!
Oh pleasant fear, oh sweet despair!
I hope you all croak!
I'm not afraid of anything! Aaaahhh!
I'm still kicking!
