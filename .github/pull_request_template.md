## Reasoning

Why did you choose to implement things this way, e.g.
- Tribals need ways to close distance with pirate raiders
- Smoke bombs allow this while enhancing combat micro
- Thematically appropriate as we already allow tribal prometheum handling
- Easy to implement
- Buffed regular smoke grenades as they are rarely utilized and to justify additional investment

## Alternatives

Describe alternative implementations you have considered, e.g.
- Tribal catapult that launches melee animals into siege camps:
  - Additional use for animals
  - Anachronistic
  - Breaks realism theme

## Testing

Check tests you have performed:
- [ ] Compiles without warnings
- [ ] Game runs without errors
- [ ] (For compatibility patches) ...with and without patched mod loaded
- [ ] Playtested a colony (specify how long)
